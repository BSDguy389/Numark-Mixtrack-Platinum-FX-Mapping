Mixxx DJ Controller Mapping for Numark-Mixtrack-Platinum-FX


Welcome to the Numark-Mixtrack-Platinum-FX-Mapping wiki!

This is a project based on the Numark Mixtrack Platinum from Matthew Nicholson. Thank you for your superb work Matthew! https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/numark_mixtrack_platinum

This is an improved version for my personal needs.

- Corrected an error in the original XML file that prevented the mapping to load, causing Mixxx to display an error message about line 5.

This mapping is fully set for the controller's four decks.
Only the VU meters and the % and pitch lines in the LCD screens don't work in the original mapping. BPM and Time are siplayed correctly in the LCD screens.
