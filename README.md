I figured out that some buttons on the original mapping were nicely mapped, so in order to stay as close as possible from it, I decided to publish this new version of the mapping fork.

CHANGES :

- LOOP button : match key

Performance pads :
- CUE : beat jump backward
- AUTO LOOP : beat jump forward
- FADER CUTS : loop roll beats 1/2
- SAMPLE : loop roll beats 1/4

This is mapped on the four decks.
