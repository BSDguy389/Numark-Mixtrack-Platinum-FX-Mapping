I figured out that some buttons on the original mapping were nicely mapped, so in order to stay as close as possible from it, I decided to publish this new version of the mapping fork.

CHANGES :

- CUE : rebecame like default mapping (CUE)
- corrected line 5 of the .xml file
- PITCH BEND + (KEY LOCK) : key lock
- PITCH BEND - (PITCH RANGE) : PITCH RANGE : match key
- LOOP button : reset key
- 1/2 : rebecame like default mapping (1/2)
- X2 : rebecame like default mapping (X2)

Performance pads :
- CUE : beat jump backward
- AUTO LOOP : beat jump forward
- FADER CUTS : loop roll beats 1/2
- SAMPLE : loop roll beats 1/4

This is mapped on the four decks.
